========

The xapi toolstack has the following headline features (note this list is incomplete!)

- [HA](HA.md) (High-Availability): automatically restart VMs after host / NIC/ storage failures
- [DR](DR.md) (Disaster Recovery): keep a backup site and switch to it if your primary site fails
- [RPU](RPU.md) (Rolling Pool Upgrade): install new versions and patches without incurring VM downtime

- [XSM](XSM.md) (Xapi Storage Migration): move a running VM to a remote host or pool, without needing shared storage.
